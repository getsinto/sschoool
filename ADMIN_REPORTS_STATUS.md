## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

The Reports & Analytics system requires significant additional work to be production-ready. The existing pages (students, financial) and newly created course analytics page provide a good foundation, but the system needs:

1. **All remaining pages** to provide complete reporting coverage
2. **Chart components** for data visualization
3. **Export functionality** for PDF/Excel generation
4. **API routes** to serve data to all pages
5. **Custom report builder** for flexible reporting

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 6-8 hours

**Status:** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE - REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT
