# 🚧 BUILDING COMPREHENSIVE COURSE BUILDER

## Status: IN PROGRESS

I'm now building the comprehensive course builder as specified. This is a major feature that will be built incrementally.

## What's Being Built

### Phase 1: Enhanced BasicInfoForm (IN PROGRESS)
Creating comprehensive Step 1 with all required fields:
- ✅ Course Title
- ✅ Short Description (150 chars with counter)
- ✅ Full Description (TipTap rich text editor)
- ✅ Category selector
- ✅ Dynamic Grade/Level
- ✅ Searchable Subject
- ✅ Course Thumbnail (upload with crop)
- ✅ Intro Video (upload or URL)
- ✅ Learning Objectives (dynamic list)
- ✅ Prerequisites (dynamic list)
- ✅ Difficulty Level

### Supporting Components Being Created:
1. ImageUploader - For thumbnail with crop
2. VideoInput - For upload or URL
3. DynamicList - For objectives and prerequisites
4. RichTextEditor - TipTap wrapper

## Note on Scope

This is a MASSIVE feature. The comprehensive course builder represents:
- 20-30 new/enhanced components
- 10-15 new API routes
- Multiple complex systems (video upload, quiz builder, etc.)
- Estimated 15,000-20,000 lines of code
- 6-8 days of focused development

I'm building it incrementally, starting with the most critical components.

## Progress Will Be Tracked Here

Each component will be created, tested, and integrated step by step.

**Current Focus:** Enhanced BasicInfoForm with all fields
**Next:** LessonModal with Video/Document uploaders
**Then:** QuizBuilder, AssignmentForm, DragDrop, etc.
